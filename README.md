## About me ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at the Philipps-University Marburg, Germany and the Hessian Center for Artificial Intelligence. I have been excited about all flavors of machine learning for a long time. In particular, I am passionate about bridging the gap between algorithmics and the human. I strongly believe that algorithms should be designed in a way that tightly integrates the user and her mental models of her material world, and the (immaterial) data collected to describe it; Artificial intelligences should be able to explain their reasoning and basis of decision-making to end users â€” in a way that relates to their physical reality and that they can understand. In consequence, my research is characterised by interdisciplinarity and a broad range of application areas. My core research interests are explainable and user-centric AI, natural language processing, and machine learning.
